# VCT Ecosystem

For the past few months, my work has been all about VCTs in support of MAXES
and Keres.

Created new software libraries and applications with the following goals for
our developers and our customers:

- Reduce complexity
- Increase reliability

These goals resulted in the following software that I actively maintain:

## Libraries

- PyToolbox
- vct_service
- vct_networking
- vct_utils
- process_manager
- vct_manager

## Command Line Utilities

- CdxListen
- CdxPlayback
- testbed-tester
- cargo-vct-help
- vessel

## Applications

- Test Bed Driver (TBD)
- VCT Launcher
- Auto Client Editor
- CdxBroker

# VCT Launcher

## History

- Began as a suggestion by Jason Ruzicka during a demonstration of
the developer tool Test Bed Driver
- Evolved into a cross team effort
- Supported by Northstar, Keres, and the "tools team"

<!-- new_line -->

## Current Status

VCT Launcher can:

- Start and stop all services in a testbed
- Start and stop AFSIM
- Display scenarios
- Swap scenarios
- Hanlde lifecycle management (STO, STA, etc.)

VCT Launcher is missing:

- Implementation of the designs from the Northstar team
- Swapping score service to different scnearios
- Service option management
