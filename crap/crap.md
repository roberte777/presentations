Why You Should Care About Your Editor

## Increased Coding Speed
- More code = $$
## Movement Through Code Base
- Skill with your editor increases your ability to find what 
you are looking for in your codebase
- The quicker you can get to the spot you need to code in, the quicker you can finish features
## Faster Refactoring
- Global renames
- Automated abstractions
- Multi cursors and Macros
## Personalized Development
Increased capability to understand and engineer code by doing it in an environment
that is natural to you.
